Steps for setting up IOS mobile testing

1.Xcode download
To open IPA files in simulator we need 
WebdriverAgent
Integration app
In simulator we can choose only the model of
iPhone version
In Emulator we can change the ram and storage.
2.Appium server should run after initiating the simulator
3.Appium inspector 
    For inspecting elements in simulator

For real device setup some things should present
Appium code before connecting Real Device iPhone

Project General Store(TILL NIGHT)

Project with MAVEN and TESTNG(08)

Tell about your self  and roles in your project
Hai I am Sibisubramanian 
I am currently working for Market Simplified India limited 
I have three plus years of experience in Software testing 
I have worked on both manual and Automation testing  
I worked on three projects my first project name is home choice it is 
e-commerce based domain and in this I worked as manual tester 
where I performed testing likes Smoke, Sanity and Regression 
My second project is Epic it is insurance 
based domain and in this I worked as automation tester 
Where I used technologies like testing, 
Cucumber, selenium , java and version control for code management. 
My third project is NatGen it is insurance based domain 
and in this I worked as mobile  tester 
I worked on technologies like java , selenium, 
TestNG, Cucumber, Appium, JIRA for bug tracking, 
Postman for api testing and maven for build management, 
Git for code management


RESPONSIBILITIES 

Checking the mails 
For ticket assigned or not need to be checked on JIRA dashboard
First of all I need to know the workflow of application
For example which module the application should start and where should it end
I collaborate with  my developing team for this information
I need to manage documents for the test cases
Commit and push the code to repository before ending the day
Pull the code before starting the work
I need to work on manual testing in some project along with my existing project
Helping my juniors regarding KT for the project



Rest API Days Schedule
Day one - post man for manual testing

http methods
GET —> Display the page
POST —> Like form submitting 
PUT —> updating

If the client sends data with an identifier, then we will check whether that identifier exists. If the identifier exists, we will update the resource with the data, else we will create a resource with the data and assign/generate a new identifier.

PATCH —> It is also for updating
If the client sends data with an identifier, then we will check whether that identifier exists. 
If the identifier exists, we will update the resource with the data, else we will throw an exception.
Note: On the PUT method, we are not throwing an exception if an identifier is not found. 
But in the PATCH method, we are throwing an exception if the identifier is not found.


DELETE —> Delete the value
Delete any values from a table or delete the products which you added (Amazon)


Authentication
Authentication is a process to prove that you are the person you intend to be.
Login in email with username and password

Authorization
Authorization is the process of giving access to someone. 
If you are Authorized then you have access to that resource. 
Now to Authorize you to need to present credentials and as we discussed earlier that process is called Authentication. 
Hence Authorization and Authentication are closely related terms and often used interchangeably.

To view the contents of yours for example sharing Netflix accounts to watch series.

DAY TWO -REST ASSURED SETUP
With java using maven project
Finish before you go for sleep
NOT YET DONE TO BE FINISHED WITH THIRD DAY


In java
Class - it is a collection of methods and data members
Object - it is a super most class in java for non-static methods
We will create objects.

JDK - for developing 
JRE - runtime environment 
JVM - virtual machine

Oops concept
Class and object

Inheritance
Deriving one class properties from another class

Polymorphism
An object showing different behaviour in different stages of life is called as polymorphism.
Two types of polymorphism
Static,Dynamic

Static - method overloading
Same class
Method same
Argument differ

Dynamic - method overriding
Class name differ
Method same 
Argument same


Encapsulation
Binding of data together into a single entity is called as encapsulation.
Example pojo class 
Where we have getters and setters

Abstraction(Abstract class and Interface)
Partial and fully abstraction
Abstract class contains abstract methods and non-abstract methods
Interface contains only non-abstract methods
We cannot create object for both


Exceptions 
Unwanted error which disturbs the normal flow of code.
Two types
Checked ———>IOException,SQLException,FileNotFound,ClassNotFound
Unchecked——>Arithmetic,nullpointer,inputmismatch,arrayindexoutofbound,StringIndexOutOfbound

Try
Catch
Throw 
throws
Finally

Array
Collection of similar data type, fixed in size,Starts from zeroth index ends with n-1
Array performance is faster

Collections
To overcome array ,dynamic memory allocation, 
no memory wastage, It is slower compare with array in performance


Collection - interface
List—>ArrayList,LinkedList,Vector
Set—>Hashset,LinkedHashset,TreeSet
Hashset - random order,
LinkedHashset - insertion order,
TreeSet - ascending order 
Map—>Hashmap,LinkedHashMap,TreeMap,HashTable,ConcurrentMap
HashMap - random order,
LinkedHashMap - insertion order,
TreeMap - ascending order


Selenium

Selenium is used for web automation
Selenium current version 4.10
Selenium WebDriverAgent only used


Selenium locators
ID,
name,
xpath,
cssselector,
classname,
linktext,
partiallinktext,
tagname
